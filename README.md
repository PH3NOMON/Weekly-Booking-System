Labs Booking System 

The Labs Booking System is a web application that allows users to book time slots in Lab 1 and Lab 2 for a duration of 1.5 hours. The application is built with React and Material UI, and it stores the booking information in the browser's local storage.

Installation

To use the Labs Booking System, you need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js and NPM installed, you can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/.

Usage
When you open the Labs Booking System in your web browser, you will see a table that displays the availability of Lab 1 and Lab 2 for each day of the week. The available time slots are highlighted in white.

To book a time slot, simply click on a white time slot. The time slot will turn yellow to indicate that it has been selected. To deselect the time slot, click on it again.

You can book a time slot for a duration of 1.5 hours. If you try to book overlapping time slots, the system will display an error message and prevent you from booking the time slots.

The system stores the booking information in the browser's local storage. If you close the browser window and reopen it, the system will remember your bookings.
